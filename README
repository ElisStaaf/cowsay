Cowsay
======
This is just another cowsay ripoff to be honest... Cowsay is a thing that makes the cow... Say!
E.g if I were to run "cowsay.pl" with the flag "Hello World!", the program world print:

     ______________
    < Hello World! >
     --------------
            \   ^__^
             \  (oo)\_______
                (__)\       )\/\
                    ||----w |
                    ||     ||
