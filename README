Cowsay
======
This is just another cowsay ripoff to be honest... Cowsay is a thing that makes the cow... Say!
E.g if I were to run "cowsay.pl" with the flag "Hello World!", the program world print:

     ______________
    < Hello World! >
     --------------
            \   ^__^
             \  (oo)\_______
                (__)\       )\/\
                    ||----w |
                    ||     ||

It also happens to include other cows with the "-f" flag:

    #> ./cowsay.pl -f tux "Hello World!"

     ______________
    < Hello World! >
     --------------
       \
        \
            .--.
           |o_o |
           |:_/ |
          //   \ \
         (|     | )
        /'\_   _/`\
